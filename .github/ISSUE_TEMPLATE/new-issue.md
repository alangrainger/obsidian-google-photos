📢 IMPORTANT 📢  - no one is maintaining this plugin, so there is no one to read this issue

The author of this plugin is now using Immich⁽¹⁾ instead of Google Photos, which I strongly recommend to everyone. 

It's only a matter of time before Google sunsets their photos app, and/or removes your access. Just check out [all the other projects they have killed⁽²⁾, or the people who permanently lost all their photos when Google closed their account for no reason⁽³⁾.

Due to this, this plugin is now in maintenance mode. You can still create an issue, but it will depend on other users of the plugin to solve it, as again, I no longer use Google Photos.

I'm hoping someone else will take over maintenance of this plugin.
